----
- Pass in a hid manager object on a per panel basis so that it can be
destroyed when the panel is unplugged and recreated when it's plugged
back in.

- Fix the check_hid function; it seems to be the cause of the zalloc crash.

- ptypes, set 32 bit library (-arch i386) in Makefile.Darwin

libusb 1.0.8 : ./configure CFLAGS="-arch i386"

libhid compile:
	add "-arch i386" to: CFLAGS CPPFLAGS CXXFLAGS LDFLAGS
	in libhid/src/Makefile
	in libhid/hidparser/Makefile
	in libhid/test/Makefile
